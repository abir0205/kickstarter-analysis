# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
    The purpose of this project to teach the students of this bootcamp how to use basic Excel functions. The modules provided step by step instructions on how to use functions and functionalities the average data scientist will have to use in Excel during most data science assignments.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
    Most successful campaigns began in May, rising steadily between April and May, and then falling steadily afterwards. Similarly failed, this period showed the greatest number of failed campaigns as well, indicating that this is the time of year most campaigns begin.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
    As the fundraising goals becoming higher, the number of successful campaigns generally decreases, although there was a sudden spike of successful campaigns at one of the higher goal ranges. Conversely, as the fundraising goal increases, the number of failed campaigns increases as well, although the data is not uniform.


### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
    I performed my analyses by following the instructions provided in the module. The biggest challenge to complete this challenge was knowing the specific syntax for the Excel. While I could understand the logic on the functions fairly well, I made several mistakes when attempting to input specific functions.
    I overcame this by writing out the logic on

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
    - Given that there are certain months where the number of successful campaigns is higher than others, these months can generally be considered more optimal to begin campaigns.
    - Those same months also have higher numbers of failed campaigns meaning that these months are one campaigns are most likely to begin in general.

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
    - As the fundraising goal becomes higher it becomes harder for a campaign to succeed and therefore there is a higher failure rate amongst campaigns with higher fundraising goals.

- What are some limitations of this dataset?
    - They only represent fundraising campaigns from a certain number of years.
    - There is a lot of data cramped into one spreadsheet, making it a possibility that whoever is analyzing this data may make a mistake during their analyses.

- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
    - A pie chart can be used to display the Outcomes based on Launch Date data.
    - A bar chart can be used to display the Outcomes based on Launch Date data.
    - A bar chart can be used to display the Outcomes Based on Goals data.
